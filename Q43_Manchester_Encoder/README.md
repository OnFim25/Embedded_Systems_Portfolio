# Manchester Encoded UART Data using CLC Module in PIC18F27Q43
Status
⚠ Reimplementation – The concept has been successfully tested in a previous hardware project, but this exact code version has not yet been hardware tested.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the Configurable Logic Cell (CLC) module in the PIC18F27Q43 microcontroller to implement Manchester encoding on a UART output.

The Manchester-encoded signal is generated by performing an XOR operation between:

The UART TX data signal

A 50% duty-cycle PWM signal with twice the frequency of the UART baud rate

Manchester Encoding
Manchester encoding represents each bit with a signal transition:

Logical ‘1’ → High-to-low transition

Logical ‘0’ → Low-to-high transition

A simple implementation method is to XOR the UART data with another binary signal at 2× the baud rate.

Implementation Details
Microcontroller: PIC18F27Q43

Output Pin: RC0

The UART TX output is internally routed to the CLC module configured as an XOR gate.

The PWM module is set to generate a square wave at twice the baud rate.

The XOR output from the CLC is mapped to the RC0 pin via the Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) module.

Sending a byte through UART TX automatically outputs a Manchester-encoded UART stream on RC0.

Potential Applications
Power Line Communication (PLC): Improves synchronization and noise immunity when transmitting serial data over AC mains using proper coupling and safety circuits.

RS485 Long-Distance Links: Works well with differential signaling for reliable communication over hundreds of meters in noisy industrial environments.

Clockless Data Links: Useful in embedded systems where a shared clock line is impractical, as the encoding embeds the clock in the data.
